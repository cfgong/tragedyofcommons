        Let us formalize this model now to demonstrate the positive and negative effects of
         increasing an extra fish. Let n be the number of fisherman, each able to choose the
          amount of fish they can fish. Let K be the total amount of fish available.
           Each player i = 1, â€¦, n chooses the amount of fish to to fish. Let k<sub>i</sub> denote
           the amount fished by the i-th player. Then the amount of fish left in the pool,
            after all the fishermen have fished is: <br/>
            <img src={formula1} style={imgStyle}></img>
            For simplicity, let the utility functions be logarithms. Player i incurs a
            benefit equal to ln(k<sub>i</sub>) for fishing k<sub>i</sub> fish. Each player also enjoys an added
            benefit, from the remaining fish, sustaining the ecosystem. This gives us an
            additional benefit of: <br/>
            <img src={formula2} style={imgStyle}></img>
          Then, the value for each player for player i from fishing k<sub>i</sub> fish contingent on
          the actions of the other players is given by the utility function:
          <img src={formula3} style={imgStyle}></img>
          where k<sub>-i</sub> are the actions of all the other players.
