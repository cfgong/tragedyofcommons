        Unfortunately, you did not fish enough fish to feed your family. The game is now over. Whatâ€™s worse was that after you left, more fisherman came to town. Because all the fisherman were greedy, Common Lake became overfished. There was not enough fish left in Common Lake for another season of fishing and the ecosystem of Common Lake was ruined.
